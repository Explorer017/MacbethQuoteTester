When shall we three meet again? / In thunder| lightning or in rain?,1,1
Fair is foul| and foul is fair,1,1
Unseamed him from the nave… to the chops,1,2
So withered and so wild in their attire,1,3
Come you spirits /… unsex me here /… make thick my blood,1,5
I have given suck …/ I would while it as smiling in my face …/ And dashed the brains out,1,7
vaulting ambition,1,7
We will proceed no further in this business,1,7
live a coward,1,7
Art though afeard to be the same in thine own act and valour| /As thou art in desire…,1,7
When you durst do it| then you were a man,1,7
[Lady Macbeth] dashed its brains out,1,7
I am settled,1,7
False face must hide what the false heart doth know,1,7
Is this a dagger I see before me,2,1
And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,2,1
I think not of them.,2,1
Is this a dagger which I see before me …/ And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,2,1
Hear it not Duncan/ for it is a knell that summons thee to heaven| or to hell,2,1
There’s daggers in men’s smiles,2,3
By the clock tis day /And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp,2,4
Duncan’s horses…/Turned wild in nature| broke their stalls| flung out,2,4
Thou hast it now| King| Cawdor| Glamis| all/As the weird women promised| and| I fear| Thou play’d most folly for’t,3,1
Good sir why do you start| and seem to fear/things that do sound so fair,3,1
If chance will have me king|/Why| chance may crown me./Without my stir,3,1
Our fears in Banquo stick deep,3,1
Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,3,1
For them| the gracious Duncan have I murdered,3,1
We have scorched the snake,3,2
Thou canst not say I did it.  Never shake /Thy gory locks me,3,4
Thou canst not say I did it.  Never shake /Thy gory locks me,3,5
Blood will have blood,3,5
I am in blood,3,5
For I am bent to know,3,5
